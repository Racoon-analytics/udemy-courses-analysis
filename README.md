Hi! That`s read me message with some comments and conclusions. 

First of all you can see all of the codes in additional files 

As you can see there are 4 different files: 

1. main.py it`s a simple code for cleaning data

2. t_test_price.py . That file includes code for comparision two different subjects on their average price. I got that result: t statistic = 3.5, p value = 0,0003 
With that small p value we can say that there is no statistical difference.

3.  simple machine learning model using randomforest to predict the number of Udemy course subscribers based on different variables.

My results: R² Score: 0.5576025503100416
RMSE: 2180.925200130968

While the R² score of 0.55 may seem moderate, it is actually a reasonable result. Many influencing factors cannot be defined accurate, and overall user behavior often just irrational. Therefore, R² score of 0.55 for such a simple model it's a not bad resulе  but there is always room for improvement)



4. visual.py It is a code for defining a correlation between course duration and price ( there is no strong correlation) and visual that shows price distrubution
